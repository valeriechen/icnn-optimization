# ICNN Optimization

The goal of this project is to understand learning formulations at the intersection of convex optimization and deep learning.

1. `icnn.py` contains the file to run the ICNN/FICNN experiments
2. `work/` contains experiment outputs
3. `train_and_test_saddle_functions.py` contains the file to run the feedforward network experiments.
4. `430_Project_Valerie Chen.pdf` contains the project report.
